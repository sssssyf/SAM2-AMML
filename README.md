# SAM2-AMML
SAM2-Assisted Multi-Modality Learning for Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation

# Highlights
Aiming at the road objects segmentation in street-level scenes, based on SAM2, we develop a specialized mask generation method under the point-to-pixel projection correspondence, which includes boundary-prompts elimination and multi-masks fusion strategies. 

To effectively leverage the complementary superiorities of RGB images and solve the challenge caused by feature-level fusion, we rethink the multi-modality interaction between point cloud and images, proposing a SAM2-assisted multi-modality learning for MLS point cloud semantic segmentation. To our knowledge, it is the first successful attempt to apply SAM2 for multi-modality MLS point cloud semantic segmentation.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that our mask generation method based on SAM2 can effectively extract objects of interest in street-level scenes, and SAM2-AMML can effectively enhance the point cloud semantic segmentation of different LiDAR baselines, achieving SOTA results.
